## Repo name origin

[Valediction](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Z7jp3MKzJhzwHCvEauLPl) is a song in album "Heart Like a Grave" by melodic death band [Insomnium](https://www.google.com.hk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiFy4GO5Nz6AhVNMN4KHfJpCp0QFnoECBwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metal-archives.com%2Fbands%2FInsomnium%2F2332&usg=AOvVaw0Oe3ckzYtuKj0dxqmZ0zjv). I listened to it over and over again before I study or when I feel lost, which encourages me to choose an uncommon path where I appreciate the charm of data and plant flowers of solitude.

## Analysis techniques used

R, Python(Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Numpy, TensorFlowï¼‰

## Data sources and description

My own studying time tracked by [WorkingHours.app](https://workinghoursapp.com/), exported as a csv file.
